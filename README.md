# metabolisHMM: a tool for summarizing metabolic distributions and evolutionary relationships

[metabolisHMM](https://github.com/elizabethmcd/metabolisHMM/wiki) is a pipeline for visualizing the distribution and evolutionary relationships of specific metabolic markers using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profiles. Annotation through HMMs is becoming increasingly popular over BLAST-based methods, however methods for rapidly visualizing and summarizing these results is lacking. This software automates the process of searching any set of metabolic markers that have an HMM built against a set of genomes, and outputs phylogenies, summary statistics, and heatmap distributions. The metabolisHMM software is primarily written in python for performing pipeline steps and parsing results, with R visualization steps added for producing heatmaps. 

Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/elizabethmcd/metabolisHMM/wiki) for installation and usage instructions.
